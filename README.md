# quadcopter-PID-platform

This is a graphical user interface that consists of digital signal processing and PID regulation. The GUI, written in Java on processing IDE, commands a quadcopter that has the ESP32 as microcontroller board, 
coded in Arduino IDE. The .zip file contains two maps, one for the arduino code, and the other for the processing code. The processing code map includes all the images needed for the software to run.

Take the following steps:
1.  Upload the arduino code on your ESP32 microcontroller. If you are using another microcontroller, then a slight adaptation will have to be made in the arduino code.
2.  Run the processing code on your computer while following the instructions of the user manual (which is not in the .zip file).
